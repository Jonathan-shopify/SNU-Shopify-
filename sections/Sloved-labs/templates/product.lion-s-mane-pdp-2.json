Lion's Mane mushroom can provide all that and more.\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"features-list list1\">\n   <li>\n      <strong>Enhanced Cognitive Function<\/strong> - Known to enhance cognitive function, Lion's Mane may help to improve memory, focus, and mental clarity. The vital bioactive compound found in Lion's Mane is Hericenones. Research indicates that this particular compound could help to improve cognitive function, stimulate neuronal growth and possibly even generate damaged cells. [1]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>NGF (Nerve Growth Factor)<\/strong> - Lion's mane mushroom is known for its ability to stimulate the production of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). NGF is a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. By promoting NGF production, Lion's Mane may support the development of new neurons and the overall health of the nervous system. [1] [9]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>Neuroprotection<\/strong> - Lion's mane mushroom exhibits incredible neuroprotective properties. It can help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. This neuroprotective effect contributes to long-term brain health and may potentially reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. We are pretty convinced that that isn’t a risk worth taking. [1] [3]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>Mood & Mental Wellness<\/strong> - Lion's mane isn't just about cognition though. It's also your secret weapon for mood and mental well-being. By modulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, lion’s mane helps to regulate your mood and emotions while reducing feelings of anxiety and depression. Studies have indicated that this is especially so for menopausal women. So, whether you're feeling low or just want to maintain your good mood, Lion's Mane can support a positive outlook and overall mental wellbeing. [1] [3]\n      \n       <\/li>\n<li>\n      <strong>Improved Brain-Gut-Axis<\/strong> - Nicknamed the \"second brain,\" the gut is replete with a vast neuron network, comparable in number to the spinal cord, ranging from 200 to 600 million. This neural web is intricately connected to the brain and is also the residence of two-thirds of the body's immune cells. So Mane mushroom has the potential to not only enhance cognitive function, but also gut health and mental well-being. Not to mention your immune system. [3]\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

[2]\n<br><br>\n\nBeta-D-glucans from mushrooms are considered to be more beneficial than those sourced from cereals like oats and barley, yeasts, or certain algae. This is due to their distinct structural features and the health advantages they offer. At Solve Labs, we exclusively utilise mushroom-sourced Beta-D-Glucans for these reasons. There are two key attributes that are particularly noteworthy about mushroom beta-d-glucans:\n\n\t<div class=\"recipes-block\" style=\"text-align: center;align-items: center;\">\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">MOLECULAR STRUCTURE<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<d style=\"font-size: 68px;\">=<\/d>\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                \n                    \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">HIGHER BIO ACTIVITY<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>\n                \n       Beta-D-glucans from mushrooms have a complex branching structure with β-(1,3) and β-(1,6) linkages.
